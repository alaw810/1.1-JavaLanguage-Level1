## 📄 Description – Exercise Statements

### Exercise 1 – Musical Instruments and Class Loading

- Create an abstract class `Instrument` with attributes: `name` and `price`, and an abstract method `play()`.
- Subclasses (`WindInstrument`, `StringInstrument`, and `PercussionInstrument`) must implement the `play()` method with different console outputs.
- Use a static block to demonstrate that a class is only loaded once in Java.
- Show that class loading can be triggered by creating the first instance or accessing a static member.
- Introduce static and initialization blocks to visualize class loading behavior.
