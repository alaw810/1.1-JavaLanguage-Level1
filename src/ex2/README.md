### Exercise 2 – Car Class and Static vs Final Members

- Create a `Car` class with the following attributes:
   - `brand` → `static final`
   - `model` → `static`
   - `power` → `final`
- Demonstrate the difference between these modifiers and which ones can be initialized in the constructor.
- Add:
   - A **static method** `brake()` that prints: “The vehicle is braking.”
   - A **non-static method** `accelerate()` that prints: “The vehicle is accelerating.”
- Show how to invoke both methods from the `main()` method in the principal class.
